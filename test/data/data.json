As we explain below, we do not store email messages, nor will we share your email address with any third party outside of your own email contacts. </p>\n<p>By using the Site or the Services, you signify your acceptance of this Privacy Policy.  If you do not agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy, please do not use the Site or the Services.  Your continued use of the Site or the Services following the posting of changes to these terms will mean that you accept those changes.\nWe value your comments about our privacy statement and invite you to email us with inquiries, suggestions and complaints at: <a href=\"mailto:feedback@sende.rs\">feedback@sende.rs</a></p>\n<hr />\n<h2>The very short version</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>We do not store or share the content of your emails. </li>\n<li>In the process of untracking your emails, our servers scan the body of your emails but we do not read the content of your emails except in the very limited circumstances described below. </li>\n<li>We do not sell your private data or sell access to your personal information. </li>\n<li>We do not currently sell ads, or display ads in our products. If we do in the future, we will not share with advertisers your email address or other personal data you provide to us. </li>\n<li>We will never send spam or any sort of unsolicited commercial emails.</li>\n<li>We obviously do not add tracking code to our emails to you.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The only data we collect is to make sure we can perform and improve the Service or other offerings we may provide from time to time.</p>\n<hr />\n<h1>The Long version</h1>\n<h2>What Information we collect</h2>\n<p><u>Personal Data</u></p>\n<p>We collect personally identifiable information (“Personal Data”) from you when you voluntarily provide such information, such as when you contact us with inquiries or register for access to the Services. For example, when you register with the Service, we may collect the following Personal Data:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Name</li>\n<li>Email address</li>\n<li>Your email authentication credentials, so that our service has the API access necessary to analyze incoming emails. These credentials are always a revocable, app-specific token and not your actual email password. For example, Gmail uses OAuth.</li>\n<li>Employer, title</li>\n<li>Short bio</li>\n<li>Social media profiles and credentials, blog feeds</li>\n<li>Data you give us permission to access (for example Gmail locale, your name). Note that your Gmail locale is not your precise location but merely a way to establish things like your preferred time zone and local language. </li>\n</ul>\n<p>We will make it clear when you provide us this information. You can delete this information anytime either individually or by removing your account.</p>\n<p>By providing us with Personal Data, you are consenting to our use of it in accordance with this Privacy Policy. If you provide Personal Data to the Services, you acknowledge and agree that such Personal Data may be transferred from your current location to the offices and servers of One More Company and the authorized third parties referred to herein located in the United States.</p>\n<p><u>Non-Identifying Information</u></p>\n<p>Whenever you visit our Site or use the Services, we may receive information from you, such as your IP address, referring URL, browser, operating system, and relevant cookie information (“Log Data”). We may use Log Data and pool it with other information to track, for example, the total number of visitors to our Site and to understand the use of our Services. We will either delete Log Data or remove any common account identifiers, such as your username, full IP address, or email address, after a maximum of 18 months.</p>\n<p><u>Aggregated Personal Data</u></p>\n<p>In an ongoing effort to better understand and serve the users of the Services, we may conduct research on our customer demographics, interests and behavior based on the Personal Data and other information provided to us. This research may be compiled and analyzed on an anonymized, aggregate basis, and we may share this aggregate data with our affiliates, agents and business partners. This aggregate information does not identify you personally. We may also disclose aggregated user statistics in order to describe our services to current and prospective business partners, and to other third parties for other lawful purposes.</p>\n<p><strong>How we use your personal information</strong></p>\n<p>We will never use or access your Personal Data for any purpose other than providing and improving our Services. We use your email address to communicate with you and to authenticate you toward our third party products integrated with our system. For example, we may use third party vendors for support, feedback, and online help desk functions. </p>\n<p>Note that in order to process your emails through the Services, we will analyze your emails to determine where to place the Senders Card and remove any trackers appearing in your emails. This is automated and does not mean that our employees are viewing the content of emails processed through the Services. However, on rare occasions, a small number of trusted engineers may access certain emails when they have a legitimate reason, like providing technical support or for diagnostic purposes, or to comply with applicable law. However, this is the exception, not the rule, and we have strict internal policies and technical access controls that prohibit employee access except in these rare circumstances.</p>\n<p>When you use the Senders Service, you agree that One More Company may scan (1) your email headers so that we may then obtain publicly available information about the sender and other email recipients, including, but not limited to, employer and job title, employer headquarters, Twitter account and LinkedIn profile; and (2) the body of your emails in order to insert the additional contextual information that is part of our Services, and remove any trackers.  Some information on email senders will be provided in your email account, and some information will be provided via the web. Email senders may choose not to share their personal information through Senders by editing and removing their information in the Service after verifying their email address.</p>\n<p>We may also use your information to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Enhance or improve your experience, our Site, or our Services.</li>\n<li>Send emails and updates about Senders, including our electronic newsletter (although you can always opt out of those).</li>\n<li>Perform any other function that we believe in good faith is necessary to protect the security and proper functioning of our Site or Services.</li>\n</ul>\n<hr />\n<h2>Third-Party Service Providers</h2>\n<p>We use several third-party services to help provide our Services, such as hosting our Services and Site, and to help us understand and improve the use of our Services.  One More Company also uses third party vendors and hosting partners to provide the necessary hardware, software, networking, storage, and related technology required to run the Services.  These third-party service providers may collect information sent by your browser as part of a web page request, such as cookies or your IP address. For example, Google Analytics uses cookies to help us analyze how users use the Site and enhance your experience when you use the Services. For more information on how Google uses this data, go to <a href=\"google.com/policies/privacy/partners/\">google.com/policies/privacy/partners/</a>.  </p>\n<hr />\n<h2>Data Security</h2>\n<p>The security of your private data is our top priority; it goes right to the heart of our mission to give our users control over their information, including their emails. We have implemented security measures designed to prevent unauthorized access to your data in secure physical locations. We use Secure Socket Layer (SSL) to encrypt all external traffic. </p>\n<hr />\n<h2>Your information belongs to you</h2>\n<p>You own the data associated with your account. At any time, you can securely remove your data from our servers by logging into your account and deleting your account. Backup copies will be purged in the normal course of backup rotation. </p>\n<p>Upon cancellation of your subscription, we securely delete all information on our servers associated with your account so new emails will look exactly like they did before you signed up with Senders. Existing emails will remain in their untracked state, and retain the small Senders Card. </p>\n<p>If for any reason, One More Company decides to discontinue Senders, all active users will be contacted by email and their account information will be securely deleted from our servers in a timely manner.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>Accessing and Modifying Your Information</h2>\n<p>We provide tools and settings permitting anyone to claim, access, correct, delete and modify the information associated with email addresses they own or control. </p>\n<p>If you create an account on Senders you can delete your account at any time. Deleting your account via your settings will result in your Google credentials, settings and list of email contacts being deleted immediately (although it may take several hours for this change to propagate across our servers). </p>\n<p>Keep in mind that your information may continue to be present as part of the Senders Card in the archived email addresses of your personal contacts, even after you have deleted it from the Service. </p>\n<hr />\n<h2>Third Party Access to Your Information</h2>\n<p>As noted above, we are not in the business of selling your information. We consider this information to be a vital part of our relationship with you. There are, however, certain circumstances in which we may share your Personal Data with certain third parties without further notice to you, as set forth below: </p>\n<p><strong>Business Transfers:</strong> As we develop our business, we might sell or buy businesses or assets. In the event of a corporate sale, merger, reorganization, dissolution or similar event, Personal Data may be part of the transferred assets. We will require any such successor business entity to honor the terms of this Privacy Policy.</p>\n<p><strong>Affiliated Companies:</strong> We may also share your Personal Data with our affiliated companies (e.g., subsidiaries) for purposes consistent with this Privacy Policy. </p>\n<p><strong>Agents, Consultants and Related Third Parties:</strong> One More Company, like many businesses, sometimes hires other individuals or companies to perform certain business-related functions. Examples of such functions include mailing information, maintaining databases and processing payments. When we employ another entity to perform a function of this nature, we only provide them with the information that they need to perform their specific function, and consistent with this policy.</p>\n<p><strong>Legal Requirements:</strong> We may disclose your Personal Data if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to (i) comply with a legal obligation, (ii) protect and defend the rights or property of One More Company, (iii) act in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety of users of the Services or the public, or (iv) protect against legal liability. </p>\n<hr />\n<h2>Commercial and Non-Commercial Communications</h2>\n<p>By providing information to the Site that forms the basis of communications with you, such as contact information, you agree to receive communications from us. You may unsubscribe from certain communications by notifying One More Company that you no longer wish to receive emails or information.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>Cookies</h2>\n<p>When you visit our Site or use the Services, we may send one or more cookies to your computer. Cookies are small text files containing a string of alphanumeric characters. This enables us to uniquely identify your browser and lets our website helps you log in faster and enhance your navigation through the site. We use cookies in order to operate the Site, and to track authentication and other session information in your browser. These cookies are not shared with other sites. You can reset your web browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, some features of the Site and the Services may not function properly if the ability to accept cookies is disabled.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>Referrals/Links</h2>\n<p>The Services may contain links to third-party websites that may offer information of interest, such as links to information about email senders provided through the Senders Service. This Privacy Policy does not apply to those linked websites, and we recommend reviewing those websites’ privacy policies individually.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>Your Role in Protecting Your Privacy</h2>\n<p>You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your Senders account password.  Never share your password with anyone you don’t want accessing your account.  You agree that any user of your password is bound by the terms set forth in this Privacy Policy and the Terms of Service.  It is your sole responsibility to inform One More Company of any need to deactivate a password.  You are responsible for all use of the Services under your account. Senders account holders agree to keep their account credentials and passwords secret to prevent unauthorized access and use of their accounts. </p>\n<hr />\n<h2>Children’s Privacy</h2>\n<p><strong>Under Age 13:</strong>  Our website and our service are not directed toward anyone under 13. In the event that we learn that we have collected personal information from a child under age 13 without verification of parental consent, we will remove such information and terminate the child’s account. If you believe that we might have any information from or about a child under 13, please contact us at <a href=\"mailto:feedback@sende.rs\">feedback@sende.rs</a></p>\n<p><strong>Under Age 18:</strong>  Minors under 18 years of age may have the Personal Data that they have provided to us through the Site and the Services deleted by sending an email to <a href=\"mailto:feedback@sende.rs\">feedback@sende.rs</a> requesting deletion.  Please note that, while we make reasonable efforts to comply with such requests, deletion of your personal information does not ensure complete and comprehensive removal of that data from all systems. </p>\n<hr />\n<h2>Policy changes</h2>\n<p>From time to time, we might change and update this Privacy Policy as we add new features and services, as laws change, and as industry privacy and security best practices evolve. We display an effective date on this Privacy Policy so that it will be easier for you to know when there has been a change.  We will notify you of such changes by posting the updated Privacy Policy on our website, and by email for materially substantive changes. You should check this page periodically to review any changes and check the effective date. You will be bound by any such changes to this Privacy Policy after those changes have been posted.  Small changes or changes that do not significantly affect individual privacy interests may be made at any time and without prior notice.</p>\n<p><strong>Effective: April 2, 2016</strong></p>\n<hr />\n<h2>Contact information:</h2>\n<p>For any question, we can always be reached at <a href=\"mailto:feedback@sende.rs\">feedback@sende.rs</a> or physically at:</p>\n<p>One More Company, Inc.<br />\n19 W 34th Street, Suite 1000<br />\nNew York, NY, 10001  </p>",

        "text_body": "<p>Last updated: April 2, 2016</p>\n<p>Thank you for visiting Sende.rs. One More Company, Inc. (“One More Company”, “we,” “us,” or “our”) provides its Services (described below) to you through its website located at <a href=\"https://sende.rs/\">sende.rs</a> (the “Site”) and through its related services, subject to the following Terms of Service (as amended from time to time, this “TOS”). Please read this TOS and our <a href=\"https://sende.rs/privacy\">Privacy Policy</a> carefully, as you must agree to both in order to use our Service. Throughout this TOS, we may use certain words or phrases, and it is important that you understand the meaning of them. “Services” refers to the services that we provide through our Site and all related services, including our “Senders” email information and untracking service, and our Site itself. Finally, “User” or “you” refers to anyone who uses our Services, including general visitors to our Site.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>Acceptance of Terms of Service</h2>\n<p>(By signing up to our Services you understand and accept these following Terms of Service.)</p>\n<p>By accessing and using the Services, you accept and agree to be bound by the terms and provision of this TOS. In addition, when using this website’s particular services, you shall be subject to any posted guidelines or rules applicable to such services, which may be posted and modified from time to time. All such guidelines or rules are hereby incorporated by reference into the TOS. ANY PARTICIPATION IN THIS SITE OR OTHER USE OF THE SERVICE WILL CONSTITUTE ACCEPTANCE OF THIS TOS. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO ABIDE BY THE ABOVE, PLEASE DO NOT USE THE SERVICE. IF YOU ARE ACCEPTING THIS TOS ON BEHALF OF AN ENTITY, THIS TOS WILL CONSTITUTE A LEGALLY BINDING AGREEMENT BETWEEN ONE MORE COMPANY AND SUCH ENTITY AND YOU REPRESENT AND WARRANT THAT YOU HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO BIND SUCH ENTITY TO THIS TOS (AND ANY OTHER REFERENCES TO “YOU” OR “USER” WILL INCLUDE SUCH ENTITY).</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>Description and Use of the Service</h2>\n<p>(Senders intelligently scans your emails to provide publicly available information about email senders and other contextual information, and removes hidden trackers from your emails.)</p>\n<p>The Service is a great way to see public professional information about people who send you emails, right in your inbox. Because we add the information right inside the email message, it works regardless of what email client you use. The Service also helps you to identify and eliminate hidden trackers hidden in the emails you receive.</p>\n<p>When you use our Senders Service, you agree that One More Company may scan (1) your email headers so that we may then obtain publicly available information about the sender and other email recipients, including, but not limited to, employer and job title, employer headquarters, Twitter account and LinkedIn profile; and (2) the body of your emails in order to insert the additional contextual information that is party of our Services.  Some information on email senders will be provided in your email account, and some information will be provided via the web.  Email senders may choose not to share their personal information through Senders by editing and removing their information in the Service after verifying their email address.</p>\n<p>Senders is not an email client aimed at sending or receiving messages. Senders only monitors your inbox to augment message by adding contextual information and removing trackers. The User, and not One More Company, is responsible for maintaining appropriate backups of the email accounts used in connection with the Service. Software will never be perfect and we strongly advise you to have your email backed up. The presence of a ‘backup’ folder in your inbox doesn’t mean we are doing backups for you. All your emails remain stored on your email server.</p>\n<p>Please also note that the Service will untrack emails that you have previously agreed with a third party can be tracked (e.g., newsletters), and you hereby consent to such untracking.</p>\n<p>We will use commercially reasonable efforts to keep the Service up to date with the latest email tracking technologies. However, it is possible that the occasional tracking code may slip through momentarily while we research and add support for it.</p>\n<p><strong>Conditions for Use of the Services:</strong> In order to use our Service, you must meet a number of conditions, including but not limited to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You must be the minimum age required to enter into a contract in the area in which you reside, and, in any event, must not be less than 18 years of age.</li>\n<li>You must provide us with personal information and other information that we deem necessary to provide you with our Service. You agree to provide and maintain true, accurate, current and complete information about yourself.</li>\n<li>You must be a human. Accounts registered by &quot;bots&quot; or other automated methods are not permitted.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>One More Company may refuse to offer the Service to any person or entity at any time and may change its eligibility criteria, at any time, in its sole discretion. </p>\n<p><strong>Availability:</strong> We try to make Senders available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, except for planned down-time for maintenance. One More Company reserves the right at any time and from time to time to modify or discontinue, temporarily or permanently, the Services (or any part thereof) with or without notice.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>Sending Us Suggestions</h2>\n<p>(By giving us feedback, you are granting us with the right to use it however we please.)</p>\n<p>If you submit suggestions to One More Company through feedback or otherwise, you acknowledge and agree that:</p>\n<p>(i) your suggestions do not contain confidential or proprietary information;\n(ii) One More Company is not under any obligation of confidentiality with respect to the suggestions;\n(iii) One More Company shall be entitled to use or disclose (or choose not to use or disclose) such suggestions;\n(iv) One More Company may have something similar to the suggestions already under consideration; and\n(v) you are not entitled to any compensation or reimbursement of any kind from One More Company under any circumstances with respect to such suggestions or any implementation thereof.</p>\n<p>We accept web form support questions 24 hours per day, 7 days per week at help.sende.rs and email support questions at <a href=\"mailto:help@sende.rs\">help@sende.rs</a>. We attempt to respond to support questions as fast as we can. However, we do not promise or guarantee any specific response time.\nIn addition, if you have any question regarding our TOS, do not hesitate to contact us at: <a href=\"mailto:feedback.sende.rs\">feedback@sende.rs</a></p>\n<hr />\n<h2>Termination and Cancellation</h2>\n<p>(We may stop providing the Services to you at any time without notice, but we will try to provide a timely explanation.)</p>\n<p>You acknowledge and agree that One More Company may stop (permanently or temporarily) providing the Services (or any folders within the Services) to you at One More Company’s sole discretion, without prior notice to you, for any reason or no reason. However, we will strive to provide a timely explanation in most cases.  Nonetheless, to be clear, any suspension or termination of the Services will not affect your ability to access your email account.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>Data and Privacy</h2>\n<p>(We respect the privacy of our users and follow the terms of our <a href=\"https://sende.rs/privacy\">Privacy Policy</a>.)</p>\n<p>One More Company respects the privacy of its users and follows the privacy guidelines defined in our <a href=\"https://sende.rs/privacy\">Privacy Policy</a>, which is hereby incorporated into this TOS.  We will not use, or allow anyone else to use, your personal information other than as described in our <a href=\"https://sende.rs/privacy\">Privacy Policy</a>.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>Prohibited Uses</h2>\n<p>(Please, simply use our Services for their intended purposes.)</p>\n<p>You must not:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Attempt to probe, scan, or test the vulnerability of One More Company’s systems or any related system or network or breach any privacy, security or authentication measures;</li>\n<li>Hack, crack, phish, SQL inject, or otherwise compromise the security or integrity of the  Site, the Services, or its Users’ computers;</li>\n<li>Reverse-engineer or attempt to discover the underlying source code or algorithms of the Services;</li>\n<li>Interfere with, or attempt to interfere with, the access of any user, host or network, including, without limitation, sending a virus, overloading, flooding, spamming, or mail-bombing One More Company’s systems or providers;</li>\n<li>Violate the laws of the United States, its states, or any foreign political entity having jurisdiction over this Agreement, whether or not the foreign political entity is a country or a subdivision (such as a state or province) or municipality (such as a city, town, county, or region) of a foreign country;</li>\n<li>Post or send anything violent, threatening, pornographic, racist, hateful, or otherwise objectionable according to the opinion of One More Company;</li>\n<li>Infringe on anyone’s intellectual property rights, defame anyone, impersonate anyone, or otherwise violate the rights of a third party; or</li>\n<li>Do anything else that could bring One More Company into disrepute or violate the rights of any person.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you are blocked by us from accessing the Services (including by blocking your IP address), you agree not to implement any measures to circumvent such blocking (e.g., by masking your IP address or using a proxy IP address). </p>\n<p>One More Company will have the right to investigate and prosecute violations of any of the above, including intellectual property rights infringement and security-related issues, to the fullest extent of the law. One More Company may involve and cooperate with law enforcement authorities in prosecuting users who violate this TOS. You acknowledge that One More Company has no obligation to monitor your access to or use of the One More Company’s Services, but has the right to do so for the purpose of operating the Services, to ensure your compliance with these TOS, or to comply with applicable law or the order or requirement of a court, administrative agency, or other governmental body.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>Disclaimer of Warranties</h2>\n<p>(We do not provide any warranty for the use of the Services. Your use of our Services is  at your own risk.)</p>\n<p>THE SERVICES (INCLUDING THE SITE) ARE PROVIDED ‘AS IS’, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED. WITHOUT LIMITING THE FOREGOING, ONE MORE COMPANY EXPLICITLY DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES, INCLUDING ANY WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGEMENT. ONE MORE COMPANY MAKES NO WARRANTY THAT THE SERVICES WILL MEET YOUR REQUIREMENTS OR WILL BE AVAILABLE ON AN UNINTERRUPTED, SECURE, OR ERROR-FREE BASIS, OR THAT THE RESULTS OF THE USE OF THE SERVICES WILL BE ACCURATE OR RELIABLE. YOUR USE OF THE SERVICES IS AT YOUR OWN RISK.</p>\n<h2>Indemnification</h2>\n<p>You agree to release, defend, indemnify, and hold harmless One More Company and its affiliates, and their officers, directors, employees and agents, from and against any claims, liabilities, damages, losses, and expenses, including, without limitation, reasonable legal and accounting fees, arising out of or in any way connected with your access to or use of the Services, or your violation of this TOS or any rights of another. If you are a California resident, you waive California Civil Code Section 1542, which says: “A general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his favor at the time of executing the release, which if known by him must have materially affected his settlement with the debtor.” If you are a resident of another jurisdiction, you waive any comparable statute or doctrine.</p>\n<h2>Limitation of Liability</h2>\n<p>YOU EXPRESSLY UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT ONE MORE COMPANY WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, EXEMPLARY DAMAGES, OR DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF PROFITS, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, USE, DATA OR OTHER INTANGIBLE LOSSES (EVEN IF ONE MORE COMPANY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES), WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT, NEGLIGENCE, STRICT LIABILITY OR OTHERWISE, RESULTING FROM: (I) THE USE OR THE INABILITY TO USE THE SERVICES; (II) THE COST OF PROCUREMENT OF SUBSTITUTE GOODS AND SERVICES; (III) UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS TO OR ALTERATION OF YOUR TRANSMISSIONS OR DATA; (IV) STATEMENTS OR CONDUCT OF ANY THIRD PARTY ON THE SERVICES; OR (V) ANY OTHER MATTER RELATING TO THE SERVICES. IN NO EVENT WILL ONE MORE COMPANY’S TOTAL LIABILITY TO YOU FOR ALL DAMAGES, LOSSES OR CAUSES OF ACTION EXCEED ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS ($100).</p>\n<p>SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF CERTAIN WARRANTIES OR THE LIMITATION OR EXCLUSION OF LIABILITY FOR INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES. ACCORDINGLY, SOME OF THE ABOVE LIMITATIONS SET FORTH ABOVE MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. IF YOU ARE DISSATISFIED WITH ANY PORTION OF THE SERVICES OR WITH THIS TOS, YOUR SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY IS TO DISCONTINUE USE OF THE SERVICES.</p>\n<h2>Dispute Resolution</h2>\n<p>Any controversy or claim between the parties or arising out of this TOS or any use of the Site or the Services shall be determined by one disinterested arbitrator in binding arbitration pursuant to the Commercial Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary Procedures for Online Arbitration of the American Arbitration Association (the “AAA”). The arbitrator shall be experienced in agreements for information technology services, either as an attorney or as an information technology professional. If the parties fail to appoint an arbitrator within forty-five (45) days of the institution of the arbitration, the AAA shall select the arbitrator promptly thereafter. Any requests for accelerated, emergency or preliminary relief shall be submitted pursuant to the AAA’s Optional Rules for Emergency Measures of Protection. If any such requests are made before an arbitration panel is empanelled, then the AAA shall appoint one disinterested arbitrator as an arbitration panel to immediately hear and decide such request. The arbitration panel shall have the right to grant interim awards. Testimony shall be permitted by telephone, video conference and other forms of real-time telecommunications. If the arbitrator requires in-person hearings, the hearings shall be held in New York, New York. The arbitral award will be final and binding, and may be entered and enforced in any court of competent jurisdiction.</p>\n<h2>Waiver of Jury Trial and Class Actions</h2>\n<p>BY ENTERING INTO THESE TERMS OF USE, YOU AND ONE MORE COMPANY ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE TO WAIVE CERTAIN RIGHTS TO LITIGATE DISPUTES IN COURT, TO RECEIVE A JURY TRIAL OR TO PARTICIPATE AS A PLAINTIFF OR AS A CLASS MEMBER IN ANY CLAIM ON A CLASS OR CONSOLIDATED BASIS OR IN A REPRESENTATIVE CAPACITY. YOU AND ONE MORE COMPANY BOTH AGREE THAT ANY ARBITRATION WILL BE CONDUCTED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT A CONSOLIDATED, CLASS-WIDE OR REPRESENTATIVE BASIS AND THE ARBITRATOR SHALL HAVE NO AUTHORITY TO PROCEED WITH AN ARBITRATION ON A CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE BASIS.

IF FOR ANY REASON THE ARBITRATION CLAUSE SET FORTH IN THIS TOS IS DEEMED INAPPLICABLE OR INVALID, OR TO THE EXTENT THE ARBITRATION CLAUSE ALLOWS FOR LITIGATION OF DISPUTES IN COURT, YOU AND ONE MORE COMPANY BOTH WAIVE, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT ALLOWED BY LAW, ANY RIGHT TO PURSUE OR TO PARTICIPATE AS A PLAINTIFF OR AS A CLASS MEMBER IN ANY CLAIM ON A CLASS OR CONSOLIDATED BASIS OR IN A REPRESENTATIVE CAPACITY.</p>\n<h2>IP and Copyright; Third Party Content and Services</h2>\n<p>You acknowledge and agree that the Services may contain content or features (“Service Content”) that are protected by copyright, patent, trademark, trade secret or other proprietary rights and laws.

We’ve chosen you as an alpha tester because of your discretion, and your product savvy. \n</li>\n<li>\n<em>Bugs.</em> The software is alpha—not even beta yet. So, in addition to the design and interface being in a very preliminary stage, it may not work properly, and may contain bugs. \n</li>\n<li>\n<em>Limited support.</em> Although we will be in regular contact with many of you, and will try to accommodate all support requests, because it’s a pre-release product, we make no promises about providing support (although any downtime on our side will not affect the functioning of your email in any way). \n</li>\n<li>\n<em>Feedback.</em> As an alpha tester, we hope you submit feedback, a lot of feedback if you want. We would love to hear your thoughts on ease of use, performance, missing features, and bugs. We may incorporate your feedback into the product, as further described in the long version of these terms. \n</li>\n<li>\n<em>Testimonials.</em> Also, if we like what you say about the service, we may ask you if we can quote you in our promotional materials, such as the website and emails to users. \n</li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"small\">\nThere’s no guarantee that we will continue to offer the service after the alpha period, although that is certainly our intent. Also, there’s no charge for the alpha product, and most of the existing features will continue to be free when we launch. \n</p>\n<p class=\"small\">\nThank you for helping us improve our product! \n</p>\n<p class=\"small\">\nYou have also read and agree to the detailed legalese version of these terms, which is located <a href=\"/terms\">here</a>. \n</p>\n</div>\n</div>",

As we explained when you signed up with the alpha, there may be bugs.</p>\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<h3>What is Senders?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nSenders is a great way to see public professional information about people who send you emails, right in your inbox. Because we add the information right inside the email message, it works regardless of what email client you use. Once you join, you will start to see new information inserted into the bottom of some email messages showing essential information about the sender.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<h3>What happened to Trackbuster?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nTrackbuster is part of Senders now. Information about trackers will be included in the new Senders footer. You can also turn this off via your Senders <a href=\"/settings\">settings page</a>. For the duration of pre-release testing, we will continue to operate Trackbuster and Senders side-by-side. But once we release Senders later this year we will transition all email accounts and discontinue the Trackbuster website. \r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nIn Senders, only personal email messages will be untracked. Your newsletters and other mass email messages will no longer be stripped of tracking information. We made this change because it results in a simpler, more efficient product experience for users and the bulk of email privacy violations take place when an individual sender adds custom trackers to your personal emails. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<h3>What happens to my existing Trackbuster account?</h3> \r\n\r\n<p>\r\nIf you used the same email address to sign up with Senders, you will need to pause your existing Trackbuster account via your <a href=\"https://trackbuster.com/settings\">Trackbuster settings</a> to avoid having both Trackbuster and Senders footers added to your email messages. Having both services connected may also introduce processing errors. \r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nOnce you do, you will start to see the Senders enhanced footer information, which includes the Trackbuster untracking information you are used to seeing.\r\n</p>\r\n\t\t\r\n<hr>\r\n<h3>What information do you include?</h3> \r\n\r\n<p>\r\nWe only include non-sensitive information that you’ve made publicly available. The focus is on professional career information (think LinkedIn) and not private information (e.g., not things you post on Facebook, which we don’t have access to in any case).\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n<h3>Where do you get your information?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nWe gather information from social media and other public sources.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n<h3>What if I don’t want my personal information shown to your users?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nIn the final product, we will offer anyone who visits the Senders website the ability to edit their information directly or opt-out of inclusion altogether. For now, please notify us directly of any inaccurate information. You can contact your company representative or email us at <a href=\"mailto:feedback@sende.rs\">feedback@sende.rs</a>\r\n</p>\r\n"
