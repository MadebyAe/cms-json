## Why do I need this?

In a small IT company, the question of how and by whom your website can be updated is a recurrent
one.

I have explored many solutions, from pure HTML sites controlled by the dev team, using fancy
web frameworks, to sites generated by the marketing/product team using pure wysiwyg tools like
Adobe Muse, not to mention heavy stuff like Wordpress or Drupal.

I finally came up with that very simple feature set:

* The **Content** part of my site is stored as a JSON file
* It can be edited **by tech or non tech people** via a **very simple UI**
* It is embedded in the web site / web app by **developers**, and exploited **with the technology they like**
* It can be **stored in Git**, so that in case of conflicts, it can be solved as with any other source files
* Last but not least, it can be run as **an npm module**. No Apache, no nginx, no PHP, no database, just simplicity of use.

Although tons of CMS products exist on the market, I didn't find any one fulfilling the
constraints above.

## What's new

v0.1.1

* The 'model' files are now standard JSON Schema Draft 6 files. See http://json-schema.org/.
* Added a 'Developer' mode, to add/edit/delete nodes and fields. This mode is activated by default.
Switching to 'Author' mode disables all schema editing features.
* On a side note, I migrated the entire code base to Typescript.

v0.1.3

* Show JSON data and schema on the right and sync with editor
* Improved author view (removed useless dev stuff)
